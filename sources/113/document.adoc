[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This specification defines the Metanorma document revision format, a structured
data format for tracking and documenting changes to technical documents across
multiple revisions and editions.

Document revision history is a critical component of standards development and
technical documentation, providing transparency and traceability for changes
over time. A well-structured revision history enables:

* Clear documentation of when and why changes were made
* Attribution of changes to specific contributors or organizations
* Precise identification of affected document sections or components
* Classification of changes by type, severity, or other attributes
* Consistent presentation of revision information across different output formats

The Metanorma document revision format addresses these needs with:

. standardized data models for revision history that work consistently across formats
. support for both simple and complex revision tracking requirements
. flexible amendment location referencing for precise change documentation
. extensible classification system for categorizing types of changes
. support for serialization in both YAML and XML formats

This format enables standards developers and document maintainers to capture comprehensive
revision information that can be consistently represented across different document
renderings while preserving both the structural integrity and semantic meaning
of the revision history.

[[scope]]
== Scope

This document defines a revision history format called the
"Metanorma document revision format" for documenting changes made to
technical documents over time.

It specifies the data models and formats for representing revision history
in Metanorma documents, supporting both YAML and XML serialization.

It is a flexible, format-independent revision model, allowing
defined revision histories to be consistently presented across various
output formats including PDF, HTML, and Word.


[[terms-and-definitions]]
== Terms and definitions

of a revision

[example]
====
"Updated clause 4.0 and 12.0. Populated clause 9.0."
====

person or organization responsible for making amendments in a revision

=== date information

temporal information associated with a revision, including the specific type of
date (e.g., published, updated)


[[core-models]]
== Core models

=== General

The Metanorma document revision format consists of the following core models:

* `RevisionHistory`: The main container for all revisions
* `Revision`: Represents a single revision entry
* `Amendment`: Represents a specific change or set of changes
* `Location`: Specifies the part of the document affected
* `Classification`: Categorizes an amendment
* `Contributor`: Identifies who made the changes
* `DateInfo`: Provides date information for a revision

The revision format follows this hierarchical structure:

often used in configuration files and is human-readable.

[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
revisions:
  - date:
    - type: published
      value:  2012-04
    edition: 1.0.0
    contributor:
    - person:
        name:
          abbreviation: JMS
          completename: J. Michael Straczynski
    amend:
      - description: Approved edition of S-102
  - date:
    - type: updated
      value:  2017-03
    edition: 2.0.0
    contributor:
    - organization:
        name: S-102PT
    amend:
      - description: |
          Updated clause 4.0 and 12.0.

          Populated clause 9.0.
        location:
          - type: clause
            value: 4.0
          - type: clause
            value: 12.0
          - type: clause
            value: 9.0
          - type: whole

=== XML format

The same revision history can also be serialized as XML, which is commonly used
for structured data interchange.

[example]
====
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<revision-history>
  <revision>
    <date>
      <type>published</type>

== Usage

=== Parsing revision history

==== From YAML

The following Ruby code demonstrates how to parse a revision history from a YAML
string:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'revix'

# Parse from YAML string
yaml_content = File.read('revision_history.yaml')
history = Revix::RevisionHistory.from_yaml(yaml_content)

# Access revision data
history.revisions.each do |revision|
  puts "Edition: #{revision.edition}"

  revision.date.each do |date|
    puts "Date: #{date.value} (#{date.type})"
  end

  revision.contributor.each do |contributor|
    if contributor.person
      puts "Contributor: #{contributor.person.name.completename} (#{contributor.person.name.abbreviation})"
    elsif contributor.organization
      puts "Contributor: #{contributor.organization.name}"
    end
  end

  revision.amend.each do |amendment|
    puts "Amendment: #{amendment.description}"

    amendment.location&.each do |location|
      if location.value
        puts "  Location: #{location.type}=#{location.value}"
      else
        puts "  Location: #{location.type}"
      end
    end

    amendment.classification&.each do |classification|
      puts "  Classification: #{classification.tag} = #{classification.value}"
    end
  end
end
----

==== From XML

The following Ruby code demonstrates how to parse a revision history from an XML
string:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'revix'

# Parse from XML string
xml_content = File.read('revision_history.xml')
history = Revix::RevisionHistory.from_xml(xml_content)

# Access revision data (same as with YAML)
# ...
----

=== Creating revision history

The following Ruby code demonstrates how to create a revision history
programmatically:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'revix'

# Create a revision history object
history = Revix::RevisionHistory.new(revisions: [
  Revix::Revision.new(
    date: [Revix::DateInfo.new(type: "published", value: "2012-04")],
    edition: "1.0.0",
    contributor: [
      Revix::Contributor.new(
        person: Revix::Person.new(
          name: Revix::Name.new(
            abbreviation: "JMS",
            completename: "J. Michael Straczynski"
          )
        )
      )
    ],
    amend: [
      Revix::Amendment.new(
        description: "Approved edition of S-102",
        location: [
          Revix::Location.new(type: "clause", value: "4.0"),
          Revix::Location.new(type: "whole")
        ]
      )
    ]
  )
])
----

=== Serializing revision history

==== To YAML

The following Ruby code demonstrates how to serialize a revision history to
YAML:

[source,ruby]
----
# Serialize to YAML
yaml_content = history.to_yaml
File.write('revision_history.yaml', yaml_content)
----

==== To XML

The following Ruby code demonstrates how to serialize a revision history to
XML:

[source,ruby]
----
# Serialize to XML
xml_content = history.to_xml
File.write('revision_history.xml', xml_content)
----

== Best practices

=== Amendment descriptions

Amendment descriptions should be:

* Clear and concise, focusing on what changed
* Specific about the nature of the change
* Written in past tense (e.g., "Updated clause 4.0")
* Grouped logically when multiple related changes occurred

=== Location specificity

Locations should be as specific as possible:

* Use the most precise location type available
* Include specific values where applicable
* Use "whole" only when the entire document is affected
* List multiple locations for changes that span different sections

=== Change classification

Classifications help users understand the impact and nature of changes:

* Use consistent classification tags across revisions
* Include severity classifications (e.g., major, minor) for significant changes
* Include type classifications (e.g., editorial, technical) to indicate the nature of changes
* Consider adding purpose classifications (e.g., clarification, correction) when relevant

=== Date information

Date information should:

* Include a clear type indicator (published, updated, etc.)
* Follow a consistent date format across all revisions
* Provide the appropriate level of precision (year, year-month, or full date)

=== Multiple contributors

When multiple contributors are involved:

* List all significant contributors to the revision
* Use organization contributors for changes made by groups
* Use person contributors for individual attributions
* Consider using both when an individual contributed on behalf of an organization

[[revision-patterns]]
[appendix]
== Common revision patterns

=== Initial publication

The initial publication of a document typically has a simple revision entry:

[source,yaml]
----
revisions:
  - date:
    - type: published
      value: 2023-01-15
    edition: 1.0.0
    contributor:
    - organization:
        name: Technical Committee
    amend:
      - description: Initial release
        location:
          - type: whole
----

=== Editorial corrections

Minor editorial corrections are typically documented as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
revisions:
  - date:
    - type: corrected
      value: 2023-02-20
    edition: 1.0.1
    contributor:
    - organization:
        name: Editorial Team
    amend:
      - description: Corrected typographical errors
        location:
          - type: clause
            value: 3.2
          - type: clause
            value: 5.1
        classification:
          - tag: severity
            value: minor
          - tag: type
            value: editorial
----

=== Technical amendments

Significant technical changes are typically documented with detailed
classifications:

[source,yaml]
----
revisions:
  - date:
    - type: updated
      value: 2023-06-10
    edition: 1.1.0
    contributor:
    - organization:
        name: Technical Committee
    amend:
      - description: Updated calculation method for performance metrics
        location:
          - type: clause
            value: 8.3
          - type: formula
