.Foreword
This document is part of the Metanorma specifications series that defines requirements for document rendering.

== Introduction
East Asian languages, particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), have a long history of vertical text layout where text flows from top to bottom and columns are arranged from right to left. This traditional layout remains important in modern publishing, especially for literary works, traditional documents, and designs emphasizing cultural aesthetics.

While modern CJK publishing often uses horizontal text layout similar to Western languages, vertical layout continues to be essential for:

* Traditional literary works
* Classical texts
* Newspaper layouts
* Artistic and design applications
* Cultural and historical documents
* Religious texts
* Certificates and formal documents

Metanorma, as a standards document processing system, supports both horizontal and vertical text layouts to meet the needs of international standardization communities. This capability is particularly important for standards organizations in East Asian regions where vertical text layout is frequently required.

== Scope
This document specifies the requirements for Metanorma content renderers to implement character conversion and transformation when rendering text in vertical layout. It defines:

* Character mappings between horizontal and vertical forms
* Transformation rules for characters without dedicated vertical forms
* Implementation requirements for vertical text rendering
* Conformance criteria for Metanorma vertical layout support

== Normative references
* UTR #50: Unicode Vertical Text Layout
* Unicode Standard Version 15.1
* ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)

== Terms and definitions

=== vertical text layout
text layout where characters are laid out vertically, typically from top to bottom with multiple columns arranged from right to left

=== glyph transformation
modification of a character's glyph when displayed in vertical text layout

=== vertical presentation form
dedicated Unicode character representing the vertical form of a horizontal character

=== typographic transformation
modification of a character's appearance without using a dedicated vertical form character

== Technical background

=== Vertical text layout in CJK publishing
Vertical text layout has been the traditional format for East Asian documents for over two millennia. Modern digital publishing systems must support both vertical and horizontal layouts to maintain cultural continuity while embracing contemporary publishing needs.

=== Metanorma vertical layout support
Metanorma implements vertical layout support through:

* Automatic detection of document language and script
* Application of appropriate layout rules based on document type and context
* Character transformation according to Unicode standards
* Support for mixed horizontal and vertical content

NOTE: the default type of layout applied depends on the flavor and document type.

== Implementation requirements

=== General principles
A conforming Metanorma renderer shall:

. Support automatic conversion between horizontal and vertical forms of characters
. Implement correct character transformations as specified in this document
. Maintain proper text flow and alignment in vertical layout
. Handle mixed-direction text appropriately
. Support vertical forms of punctuation marks and symbols

=== Rendering requirements

==== Character conversion
The renderer shall:

. Use dedicated vertical presentation forms when available and the vertical forms
can't be easily achieved through rotation the character +
NOTE: Using the glyphs that the vertical forms are easily achieved through rotation can preserve the copy-paste text into the
text editor in horizontal mode, and the easy searching also.

. Apply appropriate rotations for characters without vertical forms
. Implement special positioning rules for specific characters
. Maintain correct spacing and alignment in vertical layout

==== Text flow
The renderer shall:

. Arrange text in top-to-bottom columns
. Order columns from right to left
. Handle mixed horizontal and vertical content appropriately
. Maintain proper line breaks and justification

==== Special cases

===== Mixed-direction text
For text containing both horizontal and vertical elements, the renderer shall:

. Maintain proper orientation for each text segment
. Ensure correct alignment and spacing between different directions
. Handle embedded horizontal elements within vertical text appropriately

===== Numerical content
For numerical content in vertical text, the renderer shall:

. Keep multi-digit numbers in horizontal orientation
. Maintain proper alignment with surrounding vertical text
. Handle mixed alphanumeric content appropriately

== Conformance criteria

=== Basic conformance
A conforming implementation shall:

. Support all character transformations specified in this document
. Implement correct text flow for vertical layout
. Handle mixed-direction text appropriately

=== Extended conformance
A conforming implementation should:

. Support advanced typography features
. Handle complex layout scenarios
. Provide fallback mechanisms for unsupported characters

== Testing and verification

=== Character transformation testing
Implementations shall be tested against:

. Correct mapping of characters to vertical forms
. Proper rotation of transformed characters
. Accurate positioning of special characters

=== Layout testing
Implementations shall be verified for:

. Correct column ordering and flow
. Proper handling of mixed-direction text
